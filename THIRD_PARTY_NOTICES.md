# Third-party components

CBGPU's original code is Apache-2.0 except components with their own license.
This inventory identifies the main boundaries; it is not a replacement for each
component's complete license text or a guarantee about every transitive package.

| Component | Use | License/source |
| --------- | --- | -------------- |
| `backend/latex/` | CBGPU's Overleaf integration and compile adapter | AGPL-3.0; [local license](backend/latex/LICENSE) |
| Overleaf Community Edition | Optional editor image | AGPL-3.0; [source](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf); image/source instructions in `backend/latex/README.md` |
| xterm and addon-fit | Vendored browser terminal | MIT; license files retained in `backend/developer/static/vendor/` |
| Supabase self-hosted stack | Auth, REST, Storage, Realtime and database services | Multiple component licenses; consult the pinned images and [upstream repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) |
| PostgreSQL | Database | PostgreSQL License; [source](https://www.postgresql.org/) |
| Flutter | Native app framework | BSD-3-Clause; [source](https://github.com/flutter/flutter) |
| TeX Live | Optional compile environment | Multiple package licenses; [distribution copying conditions](https://tug.org/texlive/copying.html) |
| MongoDB and Redis images | Optional Overleaf dependencies | Version-dependent upstream licenses; inspect the exact pinned images before redistributing |
| Fonts, icons and bundled arcade assets | Product UI/assets | Preserve upstream notices; they are not relicensed by the root Apache declaration |

## npm dependencies

`docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` is generated from the committed npm lockfiles with
`node scripts/dependency-inventory.mjs`. Entries reflect lockfile metadata, which
may be incomplete. Before redistribution, inspect the actual installed package's
LICENSE/NOTICE and any package-specific restrictions. Do not assume all packages
share the application's Apache license.

CI and source releases also produce a CycloneDX SBOM for the web component using
`npm sbom --sbom-format cyclonedx --omit=dev`. It covers installed web production
npm packages only. Docker images, Python, Dart and operating-system packages need
separate inventories for a complete deployment SBOM.
